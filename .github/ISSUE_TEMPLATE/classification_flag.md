### Reviewer information
- **GitHub identity**: visible above (issue author).

### Moderator workflow
1. **Other reviewers** can add their own assessment as a *comment* using
   the same axis schema below. Use one comment per reviewer; the
   consensus-detection workflow parses every comment with a `BEGIN_FLAG_DATA`
   block.
2. The issue is automatically labelled `consensus-reached` when at
   least `CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD` distinct human reviewers agree on the
   same correction. **Currently the threshold is 1** (single-reviewer
   suffices to surface to the moderator), configurable via the
   workflow env var. Will be raised as the community grows.
3. The moderator (@ptjeong) reviews the consensus in the dashboard's
   Moderation tab. Approve → records to `moderator_validations.json` and
   queues for promotion to `llm_overrides.json` via
   `scripts/promote_consensus_flags.py`.
